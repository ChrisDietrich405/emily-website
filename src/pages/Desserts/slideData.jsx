    description: `This chocolatey treat has been a hit at many events with the extra bonuses of being so easy to
    make and chock full of healthful ingredients! They are my go-to when desiring a sweet treat for
    myself and to share with others. They freeze well and are even super tasty right out the freezer
    for a cold treat. Moist and decadent without the fat and added sugar of many chocolate treats,
    this one is a keeper! I have not made the frosting that the Feasting on Fruit recipe includes but
    sure looks tasty too!`,
