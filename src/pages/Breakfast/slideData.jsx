    description: `This chocolatey treat has been a hit at many events with the extra bonuses of being so easy to
    make and chock full of healthful ingredients! They are my go-to when desiring a sweet treat for
    myself and to share with others. They freeze well and are even super tasty right out the freezer
    for a cold treat. Moist and decadent without the fat and added sugar of many chocolate treats,
    this one is a keeper! I have not made the frosting that the Feasting on Fruit recipe includes but
    sure looks tasty too!`,

    ingredients: [
      "2 cups oat flour*",
      "2 cups dates pitted (often I use a bit less)",
      "2 cups water",
      "2/3 cup cocoa or cacao powder",
      "2 Tbs baking powder",
      "½ cup unsweetened non-dairy milk",
      "2 tsp vanilla extract",
      "Pinch of salt",
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Preheat the oven to 350 ˚F. If not using store-bought oat flour, grind 2 cups of oats until flour-like. Combine the dates and water in a high-speed blender. Blend on high until smooth.",
      " Add the rest of the ingredients. Blend on low speed briefly until just combined. Do not over blend.",
      "If making cupcakes or mini ones, divide the batter between 12 regular size or 24 mini silicone muffin pan.",
      "If making a cake, use a 8 x 8 inch silicon cake pan or 8 x 8 inch glass baking dish lined with parchment paper",
      "Fill each so it is about level with the top of the pan and smooth the tops with the back of a spoon.",
      "For cupcakes, bake for approximately 25 minutes at 350˚ F or until toothpick or knife in center comes out clean.",
      "For cake, bake for approximately 35-40 minutes at 350˚ F or until toothpick or knife in center comes out clean. Let cool before removing from pan and enjoy!",

    additionalInformation: `*To make oat flour: blend oats until a flour-like consistency is reached
    This tasty stew has become a favorite amongst are families and friends. It is often one of the
    first meals I think of making when cooking for others as it is full of familiar foods that many
    
    people enjoy with a tasty blend of spices that is not overpowering. I often double the recipe to
    allow leftover for my boyfriend and I to have enough for several meal. Unfortunately, this
    recipe tends not to freeze well especially if potatoes are used so plan to enjoy it within 5 days.
    Hopefully, it will be such a hit that it will be devoured in no time!`,
